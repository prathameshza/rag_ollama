# Government Document Search Agent

This project implements an AI assistant that uses **OpenAI-compatible models via Ollama** to respond to queries by searching through government documents using a custom tool function.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Uses Ollama-hosted models (like `llama3`, `mistral`, etc.)
- Integrates a custom tool (`search_documents`) to search keywords in government documents
- Supports OpenAI's ChatCompletion API format with function calling
- Ensures model responses are based on the tool's output, not hallucinations
